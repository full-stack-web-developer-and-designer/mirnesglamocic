# My portfolio
This is a repository for my personal website [**mirnesglamocic.com**](https://mirnesglamocic.com) that contains some of my certifications and my latest projects and updates. The complete project is done with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.

At the top of the website are my contact details, mobile phone number, which is clickable on mobile devices, a link to download my PDF resume and links with SVG thumbnails to my personal profiles for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirnesglamocic), [GitHub](https://github.com/full-stack-web-developer-and-designer) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/full-stack-web-developer-and-designer).

Then there is a navigation where you find links about me, certificates, skills, projects, services and contact. If you scroll down on this page, an arrow will appear in the lower right corner, which, when clicked, will take you right back to the top of the page.

Below the navigation is a large full-screen image, which is loaded randomly with PHP, so that each time the website is opened, one of the two images will appear randomly.

Under my short info are PNG thumbnails of my skills which are responsive for devices up to device pixel ratio up to 4dppx.

Then, there are the services I offer, with SVG images and short info, namely web design, web development, hosting and domain and SEO Optimization.

The contact link in the navigation leads to the contact form on which validation is done on the client, i.e. the browser, so that empty or incorrect data cannot be sent to the server. Also, PHP validation was done, so even if the user turns off JavaScript in the browser, empty or incorrect data cannot be sent. This contact form uses JSON and AJAX, so the response appears immediately after the form is successfully submitted.

Finally, by clicking on the projects, there are links to view websites, edited images with photoshop, illustrations and logos.

All images on this website are stored in the MySQL database and loaded using JavaScript lazy loading method, until needed. Of course, all images are optimized for faster page loading as well as minified and compressed CSS, JavaScript and PHP files.

At the bottom of the website is the copyright year since creation of the website until today, which automatically changes on January 1.

With great SEO, this site appear at the top of Google searches for web developers or web designers queries.
